
Modify your classes so that:

and LibraryCard has a non-negative balance, which is incurred if books are checked in past their  due  dates. The library charges $.10 per day per book.

Modify your checkOut method to give the BookCopy a  due  date that is equal to three weeks from the day that the books are checked out.
Modify your checkIn method to check if the book is overdue; if so, update the balance accordingly.
Note:  ALSO create an additional checkIn and checkOut method that takes a  date as a parameter, so that you don't have to wait three weeks to test your code.

Also create the following LibraryCard methods:
- a renewal method which allows the cardholder to get a new  due date for that book. Renewal periods are in  two-week increments.
- a method which takes a  date as a parameter and returns a list of books that are  due on or before that  date.
- a method that checks if any books are overdue. ( ALSO create an additional method that takes a date as a parameter for ease of testing.)
- a method that returns a list of all the books checked out, sorted by due date. (You may use an array or an ArrayList -- we're not focusing on the specific data structures yet.)

Also create a tester main program that tests the methods created in this program. You may include user input or output, but that is not required. 

Submit all of the JAVA files (NO class files, no folders) and a copy of your program output in one ZIPPED folder. Also please hand in a hard copy of your code and output. Please include your name as a comment on EACH file. 

I prefer working code, but if for any reason your program does not work, or if it crashes when it's run, I strongly prefer for you to leave a comment notifying me of that rather than my discovering of that on my own.
